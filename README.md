### Building

    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/adsr/mle.git
    $ cd mle
    $ sudo apt-get install libpcre3-dev # or `yum install pcre-devel`, `pacman -S pcre`, etc
    $ make

You can run `make mle_static` instead to build a static binary.

### Installing

To install to `/usr/bin`:

    $ make install

To install to a custom directory, supply `DESTDIR`, e.g.:

    $ DESTDIR=/usr/local/bin make install

### Basic usage

(The following assumes default configuration.)

Run `mle` to start editing a new text file. Type to type, use directional keys
to navigate, `Ctrl+F` to search, `Ctrl+T` for search-and-replace, `Ctrl+S` to
save, and `Ctrl+X` to exit. Press `F2` for full help.

Run `mle existing-file` to edit an existing file. To edit multiple files try
`mle file1 file2` and use `Alt+n` and `Alt+p` to switch between them. Press
`Alt+c` to close a file. You can also specify `mle file.c:100` to start the
editor at a certain line number.

### Advanced usage: mlerc

mle is customized via command line options. Run `mle -h` to view all cli
options.

To set default options, make an rc file named `~/.mlerc` (or `/etc/mlerc`). The
contents of the rc file are any number of cli options separated by newlines.
Lines that begin with a semi-colon are interpretted as comments.

If `~/.mlerc` is executable, mle executes it and interprets the resulting stdout
as described above. For example, consider the following snippet from an
executable `~/.mlerc` PHP script:

    <?php if (file_exists('.git')): ?>
    -kcmd_grep,M-q,git grep --color=never -P -i -I -n %s 2>/dev/null
    <?php endif; ?>

This overrides the normal grep command with `git grep` if `.git` exists in the
current working directory.

### Advanced usage: Scripting

mle is extensible via any program capable of standard I/O. A simple
line-based request/response protocol enables user scripts to register commands
and invoke internal editor functions in order to perform complex editing tasks.
All messages are URL-encoded and end with a newline.

Example exchange between a user script (usx) and mle:

    usx -> mle    method=editor_register_cmd&params%5B%5D=hello&id=57cc98bb168ae
    mle -> usx    result%5Brc%5D=0&id=57cc98bb168ae
    ...
    mle -> usx    method=hello&params%5Bmark%5D=76d6e0&params%5Bstatic_param%5D=&id=0x76d3a0-0
    usx -> mle    method=mark_insert_before&params%5B%5D=76d6e0&params%5B%5D=hello%3F&params%5B%5D=5&id=57cc98bb6ab3d
    mle -> usx    result%5Brc%5D=0&id=57cc98bb6ab3d
    usx -> mle    result%5Brc%5D=0&error=&id=0x76d3a0-0

In the example above, the user script registers a command called `hello` at
startup, and mle replies with success. Later, the end-user invokes the `hello`
command, so mle sends a request to the user script. The user script receives the
request and sends a sub-request invoking `mark_insert_before`, to which mle
replies with success. Finally the user script returns overall success for the
`hello` command.

Currently, mle only accepts requests from user scripts while a request to the
user script itself is pending. (In other words, mle enforces an "only do stuff
if I ask you to" policy.) The exception to this is `editor_register_cmd` which
can be invoked by user scripts at startup time.

For end-users, user scripts are loaded via the `-x` cli option. Commands
registered by user scripts can be mapped to keys as normal via `-k`.

### Advanced usage: lel edit language

mle comes with a built-in text editing language called lel, inspired by the
[sam command language](http://doc.cat-v.org/bell_labs/sam_lang_tutorial/). lel
commands can be entered manually at a prompt, or bound to any key via
`-kcmd_lel,<key>,<lelcmd>`.

        L q/todo/ { ^ a|//| }
    Copy func protos here, replacing bracket with semi-colon
        x/^static.*{/>a ~ Sa/ {/;/ _a

### Advanced usage: Headless mode

mle provides support for non-interactive editing which may be useful for using
the editor as a regular command line tool. In headless mode, mle reads stdin
into a buffer, applies a startup macro if specified, and then writes the buffer
contents to stdout. For example:

    $ echo -n hello | mle -M 'test C-e space w o r l d enter' -p test
    hello world

If stdin is a pipe, mle goes into headless mode automatically. Headless mode can
be explicitly enabled or disabled with the `-H` option.

### Runtime dependencies (optional)

The following programs will enable or enhance certain features of mle if they
exist in `PATH`.

* [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) (tab completion)
* [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) (fuzzy file search)
* [grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) (file grep)
* [less](https://www.gnu.org/software/less/) (less integration)
* [tree](http://mama.indstate.edu/users/ice/tree/) (file browsing)

### Known bugs

* Multi-line style rules don't work properly when overlapped/staggered.
* There's a segfault lurking in the window split code. I can't reliably
  reproduce it.
